# AI4DevOps: Multi-Agent LLMs for CI/CD Automation

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate collaborative DevOps workflows.  
Agents will handle tasks like managing JIRA tickets, creating/testing code in GitHub, and triggering Jenkins builds.

**Objective:**
- Build a proof-of-concept pipeline: GitHub → Jenkins → JIRA ticket updates.
- Introduce multi-agent collaboration (Issue Agent, Code Agent, Deployment Agent).
- Evaluate reliability, security, and workflow efficiency.

## Tools & Frameworks
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD automation  
- **GitHub** – Source code management  
- **JIRA** – Issue tracking  
- **Python** – Agent scripting & orchestration  
- **LangChain / AutoGen / CrewAI** – Multi-agent LLM frameworks
